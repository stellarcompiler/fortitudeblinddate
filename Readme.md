# WorkFlow
* Authentication</br>
Every user has to be authenticated 

* Interest/Preference</br>
We are gonna take the preferences and interests of the person , the interests will be used for matching and the preferences will be used to finalise them . 

* Waiting Area

* Matched Area

After this they both will be able to chat for a limited time , and at this moment their profile wont be visible only a nickname , in the chats they are not allowed to give any personal info .

After the time is over , both of them will get a button asking if they want to continue , if both of them give yes then the profiles will be visible , if even one of them says no then they will exit . 

This is to make sure that even if anyone is rejected after the chat phase , it doesnt create any awkwardness when they meet in college afterwards , or any other consequences.
